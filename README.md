# pre-commit-kustomize-check

`pre-commit-kustomize-check` utilizes a docker container to run `kustomize build` against directories in your repository. This repository is based on [pre-commit-docker-kustomize](https://github.com/dmitri-lerko/pre-commit-docker-kustomize),
with a few crucial improvements:

- `kustomize-check` defaults to using a pre-built image, which drastically speeds up checks, as the image can be cached locally. If you prefer to build the image locally for security, you can utilize the `kustomize_check_local` hook instead, which utilizes the original behavior of building the docker image locally for each run.
- `kustomize-check` utilizes renovate to automatically keep up with upstream versions of the `kustomize` binary. `kustomize` version availability starts with `v4.5.6`
- the `kustomize_check` docker image stored in dockerhub is now multiarch, allowing it to be run natively on the following platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/ppc64le`, `linux/s390x`

## Configuration

`pre-commit-kustomize-check` utilizes standard pre-commit hook configuration.

### Global Config Options

- `rev`: the version of `kustomize` you wish to use in this hook (this repository is tagged by `kustomize` version).
- `repo`: this repo (`https://github.com/rtrox/pre-commit-kustomize-check`)

### Hook configuration

- `id`: `kustomize_check`,  `kustomize_check_local`, or `kustomize_check_system`.
  - `kustomize_check` uses the dockerhub image built by this repo
  - `kustomize_check_local` builds the docker image locally for each run.
  - `kustomize_check_system` does not use docker, and instead uses the kustomize binary already installed on your system
- `name`: A unique name which will be printed with `pre-commit` output.
- `args`: The directory you wish to build with kustomize
